<h2>Hi!</h2>

I'm a hobbyist computer programmer and game developer. This is my personal website where I put together my projects and share things that fascinate me. Beyond computers 🖥️ and programming, I also love writing 📘, photography 📷, being in the mountains ⛰️, and studying Christian theology ✝️. <br><br> Oh, also bats 🦇. I love bats! For more about me, see my <a href="/About/">about</a>, complete with a list of all pertinent links.

<br><br>Buy my games/software on <a href="https://softwave.itch.io/">itch.io</a>, or <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jleyba92k">buy me a cup of tea</a> to support my work. You can also watch my videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@softwave1662">YouTube</a>.
