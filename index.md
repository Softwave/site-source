<h2>Welcome!</h2>

I am a hobbyist computer programmer and game developer. This is a little place I share projects of mine. Beyond computers, and programming, I am interested in writing, photography, being in the mountains, and studying theology. 
</br></br>
Most people find me through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@softwave1662">my YouTube channel</a>, where I post little videos on computer-related topics. Also see <a href="https://softwave.itch.io/">my itch.io</a>, where I post programs and computer games I've made. See also my <a href="https://github.com/Softwave">github page</a>.</br></br>

Many who've seen my YouTube channel ask some recurring questions. I've compiled them into an <a href="/FAQ/">FAQ</a> for your convenience. :)
