# Drifter

Drifter is an experimental exploration game I made with Unity in May of 2015. It’s not finished and I’ve wanted to either update or (more likely) completely re-do it for a long time. That said, I’m proud of the aesthetic and feeling of the game, and also that it was reviewed (quite fairly I'd say) by IndieImpressions/RockLeeSmile, a youtuber I do enjoy.
