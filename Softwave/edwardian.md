## Edwardianiser

A tool for writers of period fiction, made with Express.js, the openAI API and  the [Rivet AI programming environment](https://rivet.ironcladapp.com/). Particularly I had players of the [Titanic Voyage RPG](https://www.titanic-voyage.com/) in mind, when putting this together. Note that, like anya
 AI tool, the Edwardianiser is better used as a rought guide than as an all-encompassing solution. <br>

The app is accessible here. Add it to your homescreen on iOS (tutorial) and it functions properly as a mobile app. <br>
