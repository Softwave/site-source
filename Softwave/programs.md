Free computer programs, games and source code~. A number of things are Windows-only, and for that I do apologise. 

### Commodore 64

* [Weirdvision 64](https://softwave.itch.io/weirdvision-64) - The elder's have one and only one demand: bring them more moos. A little game for the [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) home computer, written in 6502 Assembly Language. Tested on real hardware. 

### Toys and Demos

* [Blazing Mandelbrot](https://softwave.itch.io/blazing-mandelbrot) - Fiery fractal program. 
* [StarFlyer](https://softwave.itch.io/starflyer) - Starfield desktop toy.

### Old Flash Things

Old toys and games in Adobe Flash; still runnable as a packed Windows program or through Newgrounds. 

* [Weirdvision](https://softwave.itch.io/weirdvision) - An unfinished, trippy, alien game. Inspiration for Weirdvision 64.
* [Paint Thing](https://softwave.itch.io/paint-thing) - Trippy toy paint program. 
* [The Worm](https://softwave.itch.io/the-worm) - Feed garbage to a giant worm. 
* [Kablam](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/634916) - Based on Kaboom! Online via Newgrounds.
