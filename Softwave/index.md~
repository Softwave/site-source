    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    
    Hello, and welcome to my webpage! My name is Jessica (though I go by a number of names!) and I enjoy writing computer programs.<br><br>
    
    I use she/her pronouns, and I support you.🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️<br><br>
    
    I have particular interest in creative coding, computer graphics, computer games, AI, and the notion of software as art. I also like old things, writing stories, retrocomputing, and being just generally old-fashioned.<br>
    Oh, and bats! I love bats. 🦇<br><br>

    I hope you enjoy my website and that you have a nice day. ^_^
