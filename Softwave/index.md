    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    
    Hello, and welcome to my webpage! My name is Jessica (though you may know me by any of a number of other names!), and I'm a hobbyist developer from the USA 🇺🇸, and this is my website.<br><br>
    
    I like writing computer programs, writing stories, and studying Jesus-y ✝️ things and (Anglican 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿) theology. <br><br>
    
    I have particular technical interest in creative coding, retrocomputing, computer graphics and games, AI, and the notion of software as art. <br> 
    
    I like old things, and enjoy being generally old-fashioned in all I do. <br><br>
    Oh, and bats! I love bats. They are friends. 🦇<br><br>

    I hope you enjoy my website and that you have a nice day. ^_^
